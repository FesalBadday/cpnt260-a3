**Issues :**

 - A bug that I ran into was getting the CSS hack for the checkbox to work by clicking the icon itself and not another button to toggle it and change its color, after many tries, I finally got to the point where it's 100% working like how I want it to work, all I had to do is to make a label and add the input along with the span for the icon inside it. I learned that I can toggle between images, colors by just using CSS without JavaScript at all and this is so cool.

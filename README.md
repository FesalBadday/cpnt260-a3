**Information :**

 - Carizzle provides motor vehicle repair and tuning services for cars in Calgary. It consists of a combined 40 years of experience in the automotive industry.
 - Carizzle is professional in giving the dash a quick wipe or changing a burnt-out light bulb, repairs or tuning with professionalism as well.

**Issues :**

 - A bug that I ran into was getting the word "Directors Board" to stay on top of the cards and not go next to them because I was using Flex-Box for the whole section. I fixed the issue by using ```order: -1; flex: 100%;``` so -1 will give it the order to always stay on top. I learned that I can assign different values to elements and giving them an order of where they should go, just link with Grid but using Flex only.
